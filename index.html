                            I'm a developer passionate about building optimized,
                            well-written, and interesting applications. <b>Thought
                            provoking engineering problems</b> and tough
                            architectural designs are my jam.  I love being an

                            Currently, I work at <b>West Virginia
                            University at Parkersburg</b> as a help desk technician
                            where I work to provide solutions to techincal
                            issues to students and
                            faculty alike. It's definitely not the most
                            difficult of work, but I am constantly searching
                            for a place to really prove myself and learn new
                            things.

                            I've grown up in a smaller area
                            than most and around here there isn't a lot to latch
                            onto as a <b>hobby</b>. Only when the world of <b>software and
                            electronics</b> were introduced to me in my early teens
                            did I really find true passion in anything. For
                            that, I hope to do great things in this field as an
                            engineer, researcher or inventor.
