                                    terminal-based portfolio (which you see in
                                    front of you!). As an aspiring 
                                    low-level developer, it was hard for me
                                    to think of a way to present myself 
                                    that I found would truly represent me as a
                                    developer. I wanted to prove that I could
                                    problem-solve in a lower-level systems environment and
                                    also make a decent looking, functional
                                    web page. Being a terminal-junkie, I
                                    thought: "what if I just make my own web-based
                                    command-line interpreter, take my portfolio
                                    and then just mash 'em together".

                                    This page was originally only meant to have the terminal
                                    as an interface, but I realize that not
                                    everyone has the time or the patience to learn
                                    to use the interpreter, so I also added the
                                    more friendly port you might be reading now!

                                    but it was definitely worth it. I got to
